This is a modified version of musl libc 1.12 which is able to be
compiled with TinyCC on x86_64 machines.

Although TinyCC is quite complete as a tiny C compiler,some features are
still missing,including:
- _Complex types
	All related to _Complex are removed.
- Full GNU-style inline assembly support.
	The original versions of __syscall4(),__syscall5() and __syscall6()
	don't work.They are replaced by assembly implemention in
	/src/unistd/x86_64/syscall.S

To compile,simply run 
	export CC=tcc			# Set the compiler
	./configure --target=x86_64	# The script cannot detect the
					  platform with tcc.
	make
